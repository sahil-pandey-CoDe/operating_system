- An operating System (OS) is an intermediary between users and computer hardware. It provides users an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently.
- In technical terms, it is software which manages hardware. An operating System controls the allocation of resources and services such as memory, processors, devices and information.

- Following are some of important functions of an operating System : 

## Memory Management
- Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory or Main Memory. Main memory provides a fast storage that can be access directly by the CPU. So for a program to be executed, it must in the main memory. Operating System does the following activities for memory management.
 - Keeps tracks of primary memory i.e. what part of it are in use by whom, what part are
   not in use.
 - In multiprogramming, OS decides which process will get memory when and how much.
 - Allocates the memory when the process requests it to do so.
 - De-allocates the memory when the process no longer needs it or has been terminated.

## Processor Management
- In multiprogramming environment, OS decides which process gets the processor when and how much time. This function is called process scheduling. Operating System does the following activities for processor management.
 - Keeps tracks of processor and status of process. Program responsible for this task is
   known as traffic controller.
 - Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process.
 - De-allocates processor when processor is no longer required.

## Device Management
- OS manages device communication via their respective drivers. Operating System does the following activities for device management.
 - Keeps tracks of all devices. Program responsible for this task is known as the I/O
   controller.
 - Decides which process gets the device when and for how much time.
 - Allocates the device in the efficient way.
 - De-allocates devices.

## File Management
- A file system is normally organized into directories for easy navigation and usage. These directories may contain files and other directions. Operating System does the following activities for file management.
 - Keeps track of information, location, uses, status etc. The collective facilities are often
   known as file system.
 - Decides who gets the resources.
 - Allocates the resources.
 - De-allocates the resources.

## Other Important Activities
- Security -- By means of password and similar other techniques, preventing unauthorized access to programs and data.
- Control over system performance -- Recording delays between request for a service and response from the system.
- Job accounting -- Keeping track of time and resources used by various jobs and users.
- Error detecting aids -- Production of dumps, traces, error messages and other debugging and error detecting aids.
- Coordination between other software and users -- Coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, assemblers and other software to the various users of the computer systems.
